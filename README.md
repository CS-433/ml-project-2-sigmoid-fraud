## INTRO
This project aims to predict coronary heart disease risk using clinical and lifestyle profiles. We use data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System to analyze health-related behaviors, conditions, and preventive services related to heart disease. Our report outlines model optimization efforts involving data cleaning and implementation of learning algorithms. After comparing method scores, we select the most suitable machine learning approach for accurate predictions.

# PROJECT STRUCTURE 

## DATA 
The data sets required to train and test the prediction models we have implemented can be found on [AIcrowd][(https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/epfl-machine-learning-project-1](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/epfl-ml-road-segmentation))
Note To run our code, please download these files and put them in the same folder as our code files.

## HELPERS FILE 
The helpers.py contains all the functions used in our run.py in order to use the implemented algorithms.

## HYPERPARAMETER OPTIMIZATION 

We ran multiple hyper parameter optimization processes with our lambdas and feature expansion degrees.

## BEST MODEL PREDICTION 

Our best model was proven to be Ridge Regression with a degree = 5 and large lambda of 1e-1. 

## OTHER MODEL PREDICTION 

We would've liked to continue and explore more avenues with logsitic regression such as oversampling and more training of these models as well as explore other models such as multi layer perceptrons for which we briefly developped some results.

## REPORT
A 4 page scientific report describes the most relevant feature engineering techniques and implementations that we worked on, and explains how and why these techniques improved our predictions. In addition it describes an ethical risL affiliated with this problematic
