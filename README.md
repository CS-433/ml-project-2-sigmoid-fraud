## TEAM INFORMATION
This project was conducted by : 
- Nicolas Francio
- Louis Leger
- Daphn√© de Quatrebarbes

## INTRO
This project focuses on segmenting roads from aerial images using various algorithms and optimization techniques. This README provides essential information on file organization and usage to ensure a smooth experience.

# PROJECT STRUCTURE 

## DATA 
The data sets required to train and test the prediction models we have implemented can be found on [AIcrowd][(https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/epfl-machine-learning-project-1](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/epfl-ml-road-segmentation))
Functions for submission are provided and located in the file import.
Note To run our code, please download these files and put them in the same folder as our code files.

## SCRIPTS FILE 
The scripts file is composed of python files defining our models, training methods, preprocessing, evaluation metrics and methods, data augmentation and imports. 

## BEST MODEL PREDICTION 

Our best model was proven to be dine utuning a pre trained DeepLab model with AI crowd submission of 0.907. It is located in the notebook experiments_deeplab.ipynb. 

## REPORT
A 4 page scientific report describes the most relevant feature engineering techniques and implementations that we worked on, explains how and why these techniques improved our predictions and includes an ethical consideration associated to this machine learining problem.
